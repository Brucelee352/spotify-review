## Overview

In this R-based analysis, I took a look at the songs that I most frequently listened to over a prolonged period of time longitudinally. 
I sourced the data via Spotify's Devloper API, using the SpotifyR package and attributed the data frames as variables, which I then used to 
plot everything out in ggplot2.
