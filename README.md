# Spotify Usage Breakdown
A review of my top artists on Spotify 

## Overview

In this R-based analysis, I took a look at the songs that I most frequently listened to over a prolonged period of time longitudinally. 
I sourced the data via Spotify's Devloper API, using the SpotifyR package and attributed the data frames as variables, which I then used to 
plot everything out in ggplot2. Spotify ascribes a numerical value to each song that the platform uses, that gives it unique qualities that differ
from track to track. Qualities like explicitness, loudness, wordiness, danceability etc., I broke down each track in my top 20 by these fields and analysed the 
differences between them. I hope you enjoy reading, please see the fully written blog version here: [blog post](https://brucelee352.github.io/projects/2023/05/04/spotify_analysis.html)
